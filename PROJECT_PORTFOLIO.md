### Purpose and goals

The project analyzes social media content for a brand in the insurance industry, using sentiment analysis and audience segmentation to develop actionable marketing recommendations.  It builds upon data gathered in Assignment 3 (social_media_enriched_analysis.csv), indicating this is part of a **multi-unit coursework series**.

### Key features and components

**1. Sentiment Analysis Module:**

- Analysis of overall sentiment distribution across brand content (neutral, positive, negative)
- Correlation analysis between engagement metrics and sentiment polarity
- Category-level sentiment breakdown for General/Other, Insurance/Educational, and Seasonal/Holiday content
- Polarity and subjectivity scoring implementation

**2. Customer Segmentation Analysis:**
Four distinct audience segments were identified using behavioral clustering:

|Segment                              |Characteristics                                      |Platform Preference|
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
|**Silent Supporters**                |Largest segment; passive consumers with low polarity |Facebook           |
|**Passive Observers**                |Information seekers; engage with longer posts        |Instagram          |
|**Holiday-Focused Silent Supporters**|Emotionally responsive to seasonal content           |Cross-platform     |
|**High Engagement Advocates**        |Most active—frequent likers, sharers, commenters     |Facebook           |

**3. Brand Strategy Report:**

- Brand health assessment based on sentiment landscape
- Content strategy recommendations for each segment
- Platform-specific optimization strategies (Facebook vs. Instagram)
- Customer relationship development frameworks

### Technologies and methods used

- **Sentiment Analysis** (NLP-based classification of emotional tone)
- **Polarity and Subjectivity Scoring** (quantitative sentiment metrics)
- **Audience Segmentation/Clustering** (behavioral pattern recognition)
- **Social Media Analytics** (engagement correlation modeling)
- **Cross-Platform Analysis** (Facebook and Instagram comparative study)
- **Data Processing** using social_media_enriched_analysis.csv dataset

### Strategic recommendations delivered

The assignment concludes with five actionable recommendations: (1) Enhance emotional storytelling to shift from neutral toward positive sentiment, (2) Expand educational content as the best-performing category, (3) Cultivate high engagement advocates through referral programs and testimonials, (4) Tailor content by segment with personalized approaches, and (5) Optimize platform-specific strategies leveraging Facebook for engagement and Instagram for information-seekers.
